# Comparison of Face Detection Algorithms
This project was created for the Master of Artificial Intelligence, KU Leuven. 
It is related to a school project of the Master Course entitled: Biometrics System Concepts, under the guidance of professor Dirk Vandermeulen.

## Overview
In this project, we compare the perfomance of three different face detections algorithms on the CALTECH Faces Dataset, using python code and OpenCV.
* Haar Cascades
* HOG
* Max-Margin Object Detection (MMOD)
